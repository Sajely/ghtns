1PasswordHelper
===
There's no Linux client/browser integration for [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword "AgileBits 1Password") which is more than a bit annoying - especially when you have multi-boot machines.  I wrote a quick perl script which allows **read-only access** to a 1Password AgileKeychain.  If I receive inquiries, I may publish some copy of this tool.   

LinkShare
===
LinkShare is a small web application for sharing URL's via RSS feed.  URL and some other details are submitted by a user.  RSS feeds are generated by another small script.  There's also companion Chrome and Firefox plugins.
