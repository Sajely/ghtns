**Pike Place Market**. Its a complete tourist trap.  This is also where the fish mongers who do the fish tossing are.  Get there early to beat the crowds and take your time wandering around.  The market has multiple buildings and most people only manage to really see the one.  Wander through **Post Alley** (bubblegum wall) while you're in that area as well.
