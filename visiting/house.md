title: The Iceberg House Rules
---

## Creaks & Groans

During times of temperature change the house can be pretty chatty.

## Shared beverages

Beverages on the counter in the dining room are open for consumption. Beverages in the cupboard are restricted; please get permission before consuming.

## Smoking

If you need to inhale something which requires burning or vaporizing, take it out to the patio.

## Toilets

The house is on a septic system, not connected to the city sewer. Please be especially careful
about what goes down the drain; only human waste & water should make it out to the tank.

The toilets can be a bit fussy. There is no need to hold down handles. Please be careful or toilets
can end up running for a while.  This can be fixed by just tapping the handles.  If you notice water
running, please shut it off as it can cause septic issues.

## Trap Cam

Being out further from the city, there's some wildlife and I enjoy trying to capture images
of it on my [Trap Cam](https://photos.ghtns.com/TrapCam).  Some notable images:
