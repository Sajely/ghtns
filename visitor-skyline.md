**Kerry Park** is the iconic downtown Seattle skyline photo.  **Bhy Kracke Park** just around the hill from it is a great view of Lake Union, Cap Hill and Downtown.  Both parks are on **Queen Anne Hill**.  They're about 10 blocks apart.  Both give great views of the city.  I much prefer the Bhy Kracke Park view, but its worth seeing both. If you want a contrasting view, take the ferry from Seattle to Bainbridge Island and watch the skyline from across the bay.
