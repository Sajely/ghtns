**Woodland Park Zoo** and the **Fremont Troll**.  The zoo is just an amusing place.  Its a fair size, though not huge.  And it has an amazing penguin exhibit which everyone should see. Down the hill from it is the **Fremont Troll (**as seen in the movie _10 Things I Hate About You_.)  If you start early,  **Mae's Phinney Ridge Cafe** isn't far from the zoo and does a pretty decent breakfast.  Start there, do the zoo, wander down the hill and see the troll and then check out the grinder shop (Royal Grinders) near the statue of Lenin in Fremont.
