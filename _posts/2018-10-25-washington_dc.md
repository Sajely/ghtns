Day 1:

- Alaska Air 4, SEA => DCA.  Uneventful.
- Blue line from DCA to the Washington Marriott at Metro Center.
- Dinner at [MXDC](https://www.mxdcrestaurant.com/).  Decent.  Very fruity white sangria.  Pollo enchilladas.

Day 2:
- National Zoo. Good. Clearly an older zoo being reclaimed. Outdoor spaces are pretty nice.  Indoor had a
trend towards depressing.
- National Musem of Natural History. Not so good. A lot of taxidermy and skeletons. Some interesting info.
A very nice geology section that was overly busy (probably because of the Hope Diamond).
- Dinner at [&pizza](https://andpizza.com/). Pizza was very good.  [Cereal Milk Cream Soda](https://dc.eater.com/2017/4/13/15295654/milk-bar-andpizza-cereal-milk-cream-soda-cookies) was ridiculous.

Day 3: 
- dirty chai @ [Dolcezza](https://dolcezzagelato.com/)
- A walk through the mall
- Lincoln Memorial
- Arlington National Cemetary.  Saw the Tomb of the Unknown and Kennedy's grave site. A bit disappointed
that I had to go through more security theater for a cemetary than I do getting on an airplane.
- Dinner at [District Taco](https://www.districttaco.com/)

Day 4: 
- A quick cab ride to DCA
- Alaska Air 1, DCA => SEA
