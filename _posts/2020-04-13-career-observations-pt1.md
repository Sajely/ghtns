# On Code Review

For my job, I spend a lot of time reading other peoples code before they commit. So much time on it, that on occasion I even give talks about it. Some thoughts, in brief, on what Code Review is and isn't good for.

## Things code review IS NOT for.

### Formatting
Formatting issues are for tools. If you haven't picked a style guide and aren't using a linter / auto formatter tool then you're just wasting time and energy.

### Finding Bugs (old or new)
Tests are for bugs.  They also are for future validation. Thats not to say you won't find or fix bugs in CR but its not the purpose of CR. 

## Things code review IS for:

### Education
Inform reviewees of changes in standards, updated guidance, or new methodologies. It's a great time to say "X is the way we used to do things but Y is better because <x>".

### To collaborate
Communicate witth others about changes in other areas.  CR is an excellent time to see the forest and not focus on the trees.
