Tried to take some photos of stars near Darrington. Attempt was stymied by a few factors:

- cloud cover increased closer to the Cascades
- moon was very bright
- lots of tree cover along the roads with few good breaks to stop in
- not wanting to bother residents by disturbing their dogs

Definitely worth trying again though maybe with more planning.
