I can tell I'm excited to have a grill.  Went out and bought a pair of birds for grilling tonight.

One chicken was liberally coated in Stubbs [Chicken Spice Rub](http://www.stubbsbbq.com/product/chicken-spice-rub/).
The other was doused  in Just Cook [Ancho Chicken Rub](https://justcookfoods.com/product/ancho-chicken/).

Rubs were applied both on and under the skin.

After roughly an hour at about 350 degrees, the birds were well cooked, came off the grill, and got
broken down.

The Stubbs rub is boring and uneventful. Something for plainer fair or easy to be made into sandwiches,
or in my case soup.

The Just Cook rub has a bit of a kick and made for good picking at to eat.  It blackened decently as
well.  It was the more pleasing of the chickens to just eat.
