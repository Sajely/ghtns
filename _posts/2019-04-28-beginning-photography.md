I’ve decided to take up photography. I’m trying to expand my horizons in ways that aren’t related to my job and this one interests me. Some of my motivations are ...

I like the idea of better documenting places that dont get many travelers. 

I like the idea of photography with little to no post-processing in an age of filters and failure of fact checking.

I like the idea of taking photos Ive created and using them as a base for other artwork. 

More notes on equipment (which appeals to my gear nerd) and locations and things I’ve attempted may show up in the future. For now, I’ve started with a Fuji X-T2 body and 18-55mm F2.8 lens kit.
