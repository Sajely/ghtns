Kayak Point is just north of Everett. It has a large day use area (for a fee - not covered by any pass) with many picnic shelters, large beach and fishing pier. There is boat access as well. Additionally it has a small campground.

When I visited I found it very busy due to an event. It was a sunny day, not much wind, and sitting along thr beach was comfortable. 

Due to the drop off towards the beach I wouldnt expect morning photography there to be interesting but maybe sunset looking towards Camano Island would be. Iâ€™m interested in camping there to see how much light pollution affects the night sky.
