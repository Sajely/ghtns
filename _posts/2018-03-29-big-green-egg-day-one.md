Got my new Big Green Egg today. Christened it with a spatchcock chicken. Made a rub of paprika,
garlic powder, salt, cayenne, and cumin.  Rubbed it under the skin and on top.  Roasted on the grill
around 350 (need to work on my temp control :| ) for about 50 minutes.  165 in 4 different spots and
its probably the best chicken I've ever made.  So good.
